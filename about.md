Cue Band was devised by a group of researchers and funded with a grant of £198,571.52 from Parkinson's UK. Cue Band aims to develop a new wearable to significally reduce the drooling symptoms through cueing for people with Parkinson's.


## About Drooling in Parkinson's

Sialorrhoea, also termed drooling or ptyalism, is a common symptom of Parkinson's, affecting up to 80% of people. Drooling can be a significant problem for people with Parkinson's due to decreased automatic swallowing. Mainly when people are multi-tasking and concentrating on other things such as watching television. When automatic swallows don't occur, saliva pools in the mouth, leading to drooling, which can be very embarrassing, restricting the social life of people with Parkinson's.
The current treatments to tackle drooling focus on decreasing saliva production. Either with oral agents, such as glycopyrronium, or via Botox injections into the salivary gland, which must be repeated on a 3-monthly basis.  These treatments are problematic, as it is well known that saliva is essential for good oral health. Impaired production or loss of saliva through drooling exposes individuals to a range of adverse effects, including significant health and psychosocial issues.

## Studies

![image info](/images/study.png)

Our study explores the potential effects of different cueing methods on the perceived drooling severity and frequency. We will conduct a comparison study between receiving prompts for swallowing from the smartphone app and the wristband wearable. Participants will experience both cueing methods at determined intervals of 3 weeks and register daily their symptoms and experiences throughout the study.

We aim to recruit a total of 3000 people with Parkinson’s, which will receive a wristband to use in their daily life as they wish, contributing to the study through anonymous usage data. From these 3000 participants, we will recruit 300 for the formal comparison study between cueing methods over eight weeks. Every participant can keep the wristband for their daily life after the study ends if they wish to do so.


### Medical Study

We will recruit 300 PwP (95%, CI=5.65%) to participate in our eight-week cueing intervention study in which we are using a within-subjects design. We will capture formal assessments of the individuals symptoms before and after each intervention method. Formal Assessments will comprise of questions from the ROMP-Saliva (Kalf et al 2011b), the DSFS-P which looks at severity and frequency (Thomas-Stonell et al 1988), UPDRS 2.2 subset for saliva (Goetz CG et al 2008) and NMSQ (Chaudhuri et al 2006) and new NMSQ (Chaudhuri et al 2020), which is a modification of the first NMSQ (Chaudhuri et al 2006).

During this time, participants will be asked to maintain a daily diary using the tools provided through our mobile app. They will self-report on their swallowing severity, frequency and duration; as well as provide any additional comments or reflections on their experiences that day. Prior to receiving the interventions, participants will complete a two-week baseline during our on boarding phase, whereby they complete the daily diary (drooling severity chart) and self-reporting without any intervention.

For our 300 PwP involved in the cueing method intervention study (Groups A & B) each participant of Groups A & B will experience both interventions (CUE BAND wearable and smartphone only); however, the intervention order will be counter-balanced to avoid learning effects or additional bias. Intervention order will be based on a randomised allocation. They will be asked to use the intervention for a period of three weeks, while maintaining the daily diaries and self-reporting. After 3 weeks, participants will receive the alternative intervention for three weeks. Following the intervention phase of our study, participants will be asked to complete a questionnaire about their experience and preferences regarding both interfaces (CUE BAND wearable and smartphone only). Participants will be allowed to retain the CUE BAND wearable beyond our evaluation; however, we will disable any data sharing with the research team. As part of the debrief phase we will assist the participants in setting up their preferred prompting method (CUE BAND wearable or smartphone only), or disabling and removing the mobile applications if they no long wish to use them.

A subgroup who express an interest, will enter a 3 week phase at the end of the interventions, when they receive neither intervention to see if there is a carry over effect.  They will then have the same follow-up assessments as at the end of the intervention period prior to exiting the study.

NICE guidelines [6] on the treatment for drooling problems recommended that non-invasive treatment options, such as behavioural cueing methods, before drug or surgical therapy is considered. Cueing has been employed to successfully improve aspects of impaired activities in Parkinson’s, such as gait. Our research has piloted this approach using a wrist- worn device to haptically cue for automatic swallowing [4]. Despite the limitations of our pilot study, we were able to demonstrate that the wearable haptic cueing was not only an effective treatment method, it was also a socially acceptable solution for PwP. While PD-CUE was able to discretely deliver the haptic cueing to the individual, the device itself was cumbersome and was not yet suitable for all day use, with participants wearing it for 1 hour per day only. PD-CUE was a rather simplistic in design, with a single toggle switch to start and stop the haptic cueing, will no ability to modify the intervals on intensity. This required for the individual consciously and manually start/stop the cueing as needed made it a less desirable everyday solution. Moreover, due to the limited functionality, we were unable to capture or understand the real-world behaviours and usage of the intervention to understand the longer-term effects.

Through this project, we will deploy the next iteration of PD-CUE, the AxLE-CUE device. AxLE-CUE has been refined and redesigned with the input and feedback of PwP to make it more discrete and comfortable to wear. Our new device allows the individual to pre-define a 7-day cueing schedule of when the device should start/stop cueing, as well as modify the intervals and intensity of the haptic cues. The inclusion of lifestyle monitoring sensors to AxLE-CUE means that we can situate and contextualise the cueing usage alongside the physical activity and sleep behaviours of PwP. Will recruit 3000 PwP to wear the device throughout our 6-week evaluation. Participants will be asked to wear the device 24/7 during this time, giving us a greater understanding of the effectiveness and acceptability of the technology within real-world use.
