Cue Band was devised by a group of researchers and funded with a grant of £198,571.52 from Parkinson's UK. Cue Band aims to develop a new wearable to significally reduce the drooling symptoms through cueing for people with Parkinson's.


## About Drooling in Parkinson's

Sialorrhoea, also termed drooling or ptyalism, is a common symptom of Parkinson's, affecting up to 80% of people. Drooling can be a significant problem for people with Parkinson's due to decreased automatic swallowing. Mainly when people are multi-tasking and concentrating on other things such as watching television. When automatic swallows don't occur, saliva pools in the mouth, leading to drooling, which can be very embarrassing, restricting the social life of people with Parkinson's.
The current treatments to tackle drooling focus on decreasing saliva production. Either with oral agents, such as glycopyrronium, or via Botox injections into the salivary gland, which must be repeated on a 3-monthly basis.  These treatments are problematic, as it is well known that saliva is essential for good oral health. Impaired production or loss of saliva through drooling exposes individuals to a range of adverse effects, including significant health and psychosocial issues.

## About Cue Band

NICE guidelines [6] on the treatment for drooling problems recommended that non-invasive treatment options, such as behavioural cueing methods, before drug or surgical therapy is considered. Cueing has been employed to successfully improve aspects of impaired activities in Parkinson’s, such as gait. Our research has piloted this approach using a wrist- worn device to haptically cue for automatic swallowing [4]. Despite the limitations of our pilot study, we were able to demonstrate that the wearable haptic cueing was not only an effective treatment method, it was also a socially acceptable solution for PwP. While PD-CUE was able to discretely deliver the haptic cueing to the individual, the device itself was cumbersome and was not yet suitable for all day use, with participants wearing it for 1 hour per day only. PD-CUE was a rather simplistic in design, with a single toggle switch to start and stop the haptic cueing, will no ability to modify the intervals on intensity. This required for the individual consciously and manually start/stop the cueing as needed made it a less desirable everyday solution. Moreover, due to the limited functionality, we were unable to capture or understand the real-world behaviours and usage of the intervention to understand the longer-term effects.

Through this project, we will deploy the next iteration of PD-CUE, the AxLE-CUE device. AxLE-CUE has been refined and redesigned with the input and feedback of PwP to make it more discrete and comfortable to wear. Our new device allows the individual to pre-define a 7-day cueing schedule of when the device should start/stop cueing, as well as modify the intervals and intensity of the haptic cues. The inclusion of lifestyle monitoring sensors to AxLE-CUE means that we can situate and contextualise the cueing usage alongside the physical activity and sleep behaviours of PwP. Will recruit 3000 PwP to wear the device throughout our 6-week evaluation. Participants will be asked to wear the device 24/7 during this time, giving us a greater understanding of the effectiveness and acceptability of the technology within real-world use.
